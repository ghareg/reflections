When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You want to use remote repository when you want to have additional copy of your files
remotely, so that even if your computer will broke down, you still have your files.
Second, you want to use remote repository when you want to share your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
There can be a case, when new version is available in remote repository
but still it is full of bugs. In that case you will want to pull at the 
time when the version in remote is operational, in order to always have
working version locally.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?
By forking the depository you create copy of the repo on your Github 
account so that you can edit it. Cloning the repo means you create another
copy of the repo in your local git client. Branches in repo make possible
to make different version of the code with different additions. They all have
different purposes so you can not use one instead of another.

What is the benefit of having a copu of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
By having remote locally you can fetch the changes to the remote without 
affecting the branch you are working on. You can see differences between 
two branches and merge them together by fixing conflicts when you want.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Without Git and GitHub, remote directory of the files should be created, and 
everyone who makes changes should put it into other directory. The person under
control of master directory then adds the changes. Without Git and GitHub the
whole process will be done by hand and will be very error prone.
