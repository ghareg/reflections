When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You want to use remote repository when you want to have additional copy of your files
remotely, so that even if your computer will broke down, you still have your files.
Second, you want to use remote repository when you want to share your work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
There can be a case, when new version is available in remote repository
but still it is full of bugs. In that case you will want to pull at the 
time when the version in remote is operational, in order to always have
working version locally.
