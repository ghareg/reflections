What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository git creates .git directory where
the metadata for future commits will be stored. You have to do this
so that git will start to track that directory as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate state between working directory and the 
repository. After you add changes to the staging area, the files contents
at the moment of addition is what will be the content of next commit.
It offers the opportunity to review your files before commit and make 
appropriate changes accordingly.
